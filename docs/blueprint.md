## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light slate blue (#94a3b8), providing subtle visual interest without overpowering the image.
- Background color: Almost white (#f8fafc), creates a clean and neutral backdrop.
- Accent color: Soft light blue (#bdd4de), to subtly highlight interactive elements without distracting from the image.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, provides a modern, machined, objective, neutral look suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Use simple, clear icons in a similar color to the accent color for interactive elements.
- Clean and functional layout with a focus on usability and clarity. Image and grid controls should be easily accessible.
- Subtle animations for feedback on user interactions.
